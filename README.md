GuyFawkes is an experiment in social justice. 
We Are Legion. We do not forgive. We do not forget. Expect Us.

Remember remember the fifth of November.... 
Right now, in the heart of our nations power structure, there is a cancer growing. Dozens of innocent lives are being destroyed by the very people who have sworn an oath to protect them. Currently, our legions are working to bring to light this horrible practice and end the abuse of power perpetuated by these dark acts. We are numerous and united. We are no one. We are everywhere. We are penetrating your systems. We are relentless, and we are motivated. We are the ones who you have let too close. You have been infiltrated. You are being betrayed. They will make you a patsy. 
    Now is the time to repent your actions and ask for forgiveness from your eternal damnation. Although your god may take mercy on you, we shall not. There will be no more smoke filled rooms. There will be no more deals. This is the end for you. You have let your perversions compromise you as a person of character and you have put the nation at risk. You are being given up by the very people you have protected. The ax must fall. You have the choice to do the right thing now or end up like the others you your self have helped to liquidate. You know how this ends. 
    
GuyFawkes -- A currency to be used to fund the white hats who must "drop out" until operation "Achilles" has concluded and it is safe to return to our normal lives. This is a very high stakes game we have initiated and the cost will be more than these digital assets we have created today. It is very risky for an insider to betray the power structure.

OPERATION ACHILLES--

We have a mole who has begun the process of penetrating your defenses. We are sniffing every packet, we are analyzing every layer. We have the handshake. We are inside of you. We are everywhere. We will find the money. We can prove you have abused your position. It was us in the bookstore. It shall be us when your vault is penetrated. You have become arrogant and boastful. You have let your sickness overtake you. We have sacrificed much. We have more to give.
